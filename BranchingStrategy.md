## Branching Strategy
To ensure that all contributors can work in a consistent manner, we have settled on the following branching strategy:

O------------------- Main -------O-----------------------------------------O---------------O
\________feature/description____/  \________ bugfix/description __________/
  
 This will ensure that we can keep bugfixes and features separate
 
 Since we have multiple repositorties, if a feature affects more than 1 project, then use the same feature/description or bugfix/description
